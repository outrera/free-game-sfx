This is a haunting short music piece. Low key and pleasant despite beeing a little kooky or spooky. I imagine it could be used for a subterranean place, a wet old place, fairy magic. Maybe for a puzzle too. It seems curious and mildly intellectual without a lot of pressure.

Feel free to remix it however you'd like.
