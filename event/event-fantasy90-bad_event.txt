I made a simple music for situations of danger. This turned out to be similar to the music in DinoCrisis when raptos appear.

The file contains two tracks. One is danger.ogg and the other is sight.ogg which I made to use in situations of warning for imminent danger such as when the adventurers spot some bone rests.

Note I am using a LIVE linux to install it and remove completely window, therefore at moment I cannot use audacity to add the sound sight.ogg in the preview but it is inside the file. Enjoy!
