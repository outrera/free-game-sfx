I made an extension pack of my older creature sfx pack.
https://opengameart.org/content/80-cc0-creature-sfx

It includes these sound effects:

6x alien
5x attack
1x breath
9x bug
4x die
4x grunt
8x human
13x misc
13x monster
3x roar
8x slime
1x snore
1x stomp
4x weird

The file names don't begin from 1 to make it work better with the first pack (for example the first pack has alien_01 to alien_06 sounds and the second pack has alien_07 to alien_12 sounds)
