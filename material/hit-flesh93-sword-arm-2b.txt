This is a group of SFX for a game jam game that never came to light. It was based on fighting zombies and the team wanted a real "fleshy" sort of vibe. 

Sounds come in pairs, one for an armored hit and one for an unarmored hit. Each hit type has an standard and alternative sound. So each hit type has a total of four files.

Hit Types:

    Gun
    Hammer
    Piercing (Arrow)
    Punch
    Sword
