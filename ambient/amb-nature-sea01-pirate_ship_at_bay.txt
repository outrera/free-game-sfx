Listen through random freesound samples, I came across hello_flower's 'SHIP SOUND REQUEST' Although it is a pretty good sample, I saw several problems:1. It wasn't great quality2. It didn't have stereo effects3. It was quite short (only 10 seconds of actual audio)Despite this, it was a great sample and I knew I could fix it up a bit. Using volivieri's shore03.aiff, acclivity's ShipsBell.wav, dobroide's 20080807.seagulls.wav, and hello_flowers original ship sample, I created this. A higher quality, longer, and fully loopable remix using only a few components of the original. Enjoy, comment and rate!
