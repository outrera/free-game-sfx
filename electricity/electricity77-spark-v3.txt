Audio of electricity violently sparking from railroad contact with a commuter train at Milford Station, Surrey. There had been a heavy frost over night causing ice to appear on the lines and workmen were trying to de-ice them. Due to the track power lines being iced, this caused a more violent electric outburst than usual when they came in contact with a train, and this was what one sounded like as the train tried to leave the station.
