A small collection of voices originally recorded for a Ludum Dare project. The minions and all of the hero/enemy voices are of various cheesy caricatures! I hope you can make something awesome with them!

For the naming scheme: "See" indicates the character sees an enemy, "Attack" might be when they attack, "Bomb" is when they're hit with a bomb item, etc.
