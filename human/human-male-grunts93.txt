Here's a big ol' pack of sound effects I've recorded over the years. Most can also be found on my Freesound.org profile: https://freesound.org/people/OwlStorm/

Doesn't include the 8-bit retro sounds I already put on here.

In this pack:
    A few ambient sounds
    Some fabric movement/rustle sounds
    Footsteps
    General human sounds - breathing, laughing, coughing etc
    Metallic, ceramic, dull impact sounds
    Paper sounds
    UI sounds
    Synth/scifi sounds
    Technology
    Water sounds

There's nothing really special here, but I've got a lot of compliments on Freesound over the years so I guess they're useful.
